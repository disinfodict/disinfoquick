The **Disinfo Dictionary** is a well-organized, searchable and linkable online resource that debunks chronic Russian narratives with selected facts about Russia's war on Ukraine. Disinfo Dictionary is aimed at different target groups: It is a time-saver for journalists, fact-checkers, disinfo activists, social network users and all citizens seeking reliable information about Russia and Ukraine. Disinfo Dictionary is both a web dictionary for searching and reference and a structured book that can be read from start to finish. It can be read online, on a smartphone, or downloaded as a pdf or epub; with a screen reader, the epub serves as an audio book. Disinfo Dictionary is bilingual (German/English), free open source, expandable and fills a gap between the [EUvsDisinfo database](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/) of the EU diplomatic service and Wikipedia. 

We hope that the Disinfo Dictionary will help to reduce Russia's rampant propaganda about its war in Ukraine and thus contribute to a more resilient societyand security in Europe.  **read. share. join.**
