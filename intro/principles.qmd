## Basic principles

-   we write the dictionary in simple [markdown language](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
-   we keep the dictionary source version controlled on [github](https://github.com/disinfodict/disinfodict)
-   we publish the dictionary under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license:
    -   **CC**: **C**reative **C**ommons license - guarantees that the content survives in the publis domain
    -   **BY**: credit must be given to the creator - transparency and appreciation
    -   **NC**: only **N**on-**C**ommercial uses of the work are permitted - we don't want people to pay for something that is freely available
    -   **ND**: **N**o **D**erivatives or adaptations of the work are permitted - prevents tampering with the holy truth of the content


## Authoring principles

### Readability

We try to keep the dictionary readable like a book. This implies that we try to avoid repeating content and rather prefer to cross-reference to the part/chapter/section which most suitably hosts this content.

### Parts

The dictionary is divided thematically into parts. The parts are separate folders on Github and the names of the parts are displayed in the navigation at the top level of the dictionary (left).

- Folder names may not be renamed (they are part of the permanent references)
- Navigation names of parts can be renamed in file `_quarto.yml`
- and the sequence of the chapters in the navigation can be changed in `_quarto.yml`

### Chapters

A part consists of chapter `*.qmd` files, chapter titles are shown second-level dictionary navigation (left side).

- filenames must be unique within their folder, e.g. `intro/principles.qmd`
- the folders and filenames serve as target for html links, e.g. `https://disinfodict/intro/principles.html`
- a chapter has a title, e.g. `# Intro | Principles` (visible in navigation)
- followed by a cross-reference target derived from the filename, e.g. `{#sec-intro-principles}` which can be referenced by `@sec-intro-principles` (always english and never changed)
- files must not be put into a different part (file locations are part of permanent references)
- file names must not be changed (they are part of permanent references)
- but chapter titles can be changed improving appearance and navigation, e.g. `# Values & Principles`
- and the sequence of the chapters in the navigation can be changed in `_quarto.yml`
- a chapter begins with one-sentence disinformation only in a callout-caution ('Myth'). If possible, we list contradictory propaganda lies. -   immediately followed by a one- or two-sentence callout-tip ('Truth')
- The EUvsDisinfo icon [![EUvsDisinfo icon](../all_common_img/EUvsDisinfo_400x240.jpg){height=1em}](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=lies&disinfo_language%5B%5D=English&sort=relevance) links to a keyword search on [euvsdisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/)


### Sections

Chapters are organized in *fact-sections*:

-   with concise fact headers shown in the chapter navigation (right side)
-   that can be read as a quick storyline
-   fact-sections expand their header with explanations and sources
-   the sequence of fact-sections can be changed
-   section headers can, but should not be changed (breaks links to `<partfoldername>/<chapterfilename>#<sectiontitle>`)


### Translations

- a chapter can be written in English or German first
- we strive to off all chapters in all supported languages (see the globe 🌐 language selector in the upper left corner)
- we never use machine translation without checking and correcting and we use the high-quality translator from [deepl](https://deepl.com)
- we only translate into languages we speak well, and if we are not native speakers, we use [deepl](https://deepl.com) back-translations to check the meaning
- without translations our technology falls back to english


## Style guide

### Pyramid principle

We don't write towards a punch line, but start with the core statement or statements and then elaborate on this. Many people don't read to the end, so the most important things have to come first. E.g. in @sec-culture-russia:

::: {.callout-tip title=“Truth”}
- Russia is killing the culture in its colonies and appropriating the culture of its invaded neighbors.
- Russia's true culture is corruption and lies, violence and fear. 
:::

At the next level, the section headings then form a line of argument (or simply enumeration) of the arguments, which are then further explained and substantiated in the sections.


### No false balance

We want to counter Russian lies with truths. We don't want to be balanced. There is enough false balance. Take the culture section, for example. Wikipedia would simply list the most important examples of Russian and Ukrainian culture. We are not Wikipedia. We have two chapters, one on the supposedly “Great” Russian culture and one on the supposedly inferior or non-existent Ukrainian culture. We counter these Russian lies, on the one hand, with wonderful examples of Ukrainian culture (and this chapter should be quite long). On the other hand, we deconstruct the fairy tale of the “Great Russian Culture” by showing that Russian culture is a fake giant because 

- Russia is murdering the culture of Ukraine (and other colonies)
- Russia appropriates the culture of Ukraine (and other colonies)
- an alleged highlight of Russian culture, the Russian “national poet” Pushkin was in reality a Russian imperial poet, who partly operated with fascist imagery, and could not be more different from the freedom-loving Ukrainian national poets.


## Sustainability principles

-   we prefer quotes from sustainable sources such as books, journals
-   we use links that we expect to work for long (dead links harm search engine visibility)
-   we prefer tables over pictures
-   we use data based charts or other executed R-code only if absolutely necessary
-   we use pictures only if absolutely necessary (pictures cause network traffic, consume energy and emit CO2)
-   we minimize picture size (svg or png or jpg, ≤ 1280 x 1280 Pixel and reasonably compressed)
-   we prefer square pictures, and prefer 3:4 resp. 4:3 over 9:16 and 16:9


## Contribute {#sec-intro-principles-contribute}

You can send plaintext suggestions for improvements, we do not accept binary files for security reasons. Please use the [quarto markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) .qmd fileformat and send to [contribute [at] disinfodict [dot] org](mailto:contribute@disinfodict.org). The qmd syntax for defining section headers, footnotes and integrate pictures is simple, see for example the *part brothers | chapter russia* [in the dictionary](#sec-brothers-russia) and [on github](https://github.com/disinfodict/disinfodict/blob/main/brothers/russia.qmd). There is also a [mini demo dictionary](https://github.com/disinfodict/disinfoquick) for learning.
