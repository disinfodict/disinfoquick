	abstract = {In this study, we explore online informational warfare by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) against Ukraine during the military conflict in Donbass. Introducing a digital dimension to the long-standing Russian disinformation strategy of reflexive control as a historic and theoretical framework, we investigate how the IRA combined online news and social media platforms to promote propaganda to its growing number of followers. Combining computational and qualitative content analyses with time series modeling, we demonstrate how the IRA blurs distinctions between fact and fiction through interlinks among digital platforms, and we expose its successful strategies for follower growth on Twitter. We conclude with implications for understanding and promptly identifying modern hybrid warfare strategies, with a focus on coordinated multiplatform efforts that spread disinformation through the hybrid media ecosystem.}

Reflexive control contains underlying elements that could help give structure to analyses of strategic behavior by using a nonlinear approach that aims to improve the quality of assessments. This exploratory literature study reviews the interpretations of the concept of reflexive control, how elements of reflexive control link to the more widely accepted existing body of knowledge, and how they could be valuable additions to the current work on the analysis of strategic behavior.},

        abstract = {Russian disinformation is not new. It demonstrates more continuity than change from its Soviet antecedents. The most signi cant changes are the lack of a universal ideology and the evolution of means of delivery. Putin?s Russkii mir (Russian World) is not as universal in its appeal as Soviet communism was. On the other hand, Russia has updated how it disseminates its disinformation. The Soviet experience with disinformation can be divided into two theatres: offensive disinformation, which sought to in uence decision-makers and public opinion abroad and defensive, which sought to in uence Soviet citizens. This study will examine Soviet offensive and defensive disinformation and compare it to Russian offensive and defensive disinformation. }
